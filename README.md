## About Me
As a Lead Software Quality Assurance Engineer and Scrum Master, I am dedicated to enhancing software quality through innovative automation and strategic testing. I excel in designing test frameworks and automated solutions that streamline processes and improve efficiency.

Drawing on experience in both automated and manual testing, I leverage innovative solutions to ensure comprehensive test coverage and reliability. I advocate for product quality through feature, functional, performance, regression, and end-to-end testing. My expertise in defect tracking helps promptly resolve issues, maintaining the highest standards.

I excel at analyzing functional specifications to ensure precise requirements. As an advocate for Agile methodologies, I lead teams in Agile practices to foster collaboration and adaptability, ensuring projects align with business goals. I manage testing and deployment activities within CI/CD pipelines, ensuring smooth transitions throughout the SDLC.

My strategic approach and meticulous attention to detail ensure that software products not only meet but exceed user expectations, delivering exceptional value.\
