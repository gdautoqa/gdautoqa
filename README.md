## About Me
As a Lead QA Engineer and Scrum Master, I drive software quality through strategic testing and advanced automation. I design robust test frameworks and automated solutions to enhance efficiency and ensure comprehensive coverage.

With expertise in both automated and manual testing, I maintain high standards across feature, functional, performance, regression, and end-to-end testing. My proficiency in defect tracking leads to swift issue resolution.

I translate functional specifications into precise requirements, ensuring product alignment with user expectations. Leading Agile teams, I foster collaboration and adaptability, ensuring projects meet business goals. My management of CI/CD pipelines supports seamless integration throughout the SDLC.

Through strategic and meticulous practices, I ensure software exceeds user expectations and delivers exceptional value.\
